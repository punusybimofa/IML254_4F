<div class="text3">
<p>  I started to love reading back in high school. The first novel that make go from owning one novel to 'full rack' was "Hatiku Memilihmu" by PHIDOT. Meanwhile, for drawing since I was a kid I already have the talent to draw decently, and I improved a lot in high school since I enrolled in art stream, and I enjoyed doing those. It makes me feel like I'm in my own colourful, calming world♡₊˚ 🦢・₊ ♪ ✧</p></div>

<p> Recently, I just finish another drama, it is a german drama, called 'Maxton Hall'refers to a series of young adult novels by German author Mona Kasten. The series is well-known in Germany and has been translated into several languages. It follows the lives of students at a prestigious boarding school called Maxton Hall College. The series combines elements of romance, drama, and coming-of-age themes. Overall, the Maxton Hall series combines romance, intrigue, and emotional growth, set against the backdrop of an elite boarding school. It appeals to readers who enjoy contemporary young adult fiction with a mix of drama and romance. And here are some of my favourite scenes!! </div>
